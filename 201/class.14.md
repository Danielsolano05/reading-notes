## CSS Transforms


### What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
- It Gives them the chance to use different ways to change the size position and even the element itself. starting with a vender prefix followed by  using transform then by scale. 

Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
- two dimension transformer and three dimension transformer,

- two dimension transformers allows you to work on the x and y axis, 2d rotation allowing the box or element to rotate in a 0-360 degrees. using positive allows for object to rotate clock wise while a negative will result in a counter clock wise rotation. how i could see this being used in a really website could be to make a image interactive or if you were to used text it could allow for writing to show on one side and a picture or a different writing on the other side. like in a qizlet where a word is shown and on the back of it the definition  is there.
-some other properties include 2d cube allowing for a object to look 3d,  translate position changes, scale different sizes of a object to scale. 

- the 3 three dimension transformers allow you to work on a x,y,and z dimension allowing for length and with and depth of a element to be defined.
3d rotation like 2d rotation but it can rotate both ways.


## CSS Transitions & Animations


### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
- It allows a developer to change how a object can look from color changing to its shape changing.

How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
- it is different in the way that it allows you to move the object from one place to another while a transition tends to stay mostly on the same section while animation moves around more trough the page.
