# notes 10 


## In todays reading I read about syntax and logical error as well as some debugging. 


## What went wrong 

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- Some key differences between them are syntax errors usually come up due to incorrectly spelling of word either with spacing capitalization or incorrect spelling. In addition to this usually it provides you with a sentence telling you have a error making theme easier to find. while a logic error don't have a notification to tell you what is wrong with the code. The code can still function with a logic error but what occurs here is it is giving you the wrong or incorrect answer. usually making them harder to fix because it is not directly telling you where you error is. 

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- Some errors I experienced in the previous lab assignment most of theme where syntax errors. it mostly hade to do with my spelling consistency and forgetting to call some elements I was able to correct them by going into the console and looking at the mistakes and what line they where in first I would inspect them then if I couldn't figure them out I would plug them into ChatGPT to help me fix the errors I could not catch.
 
### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- This topic will continue to influence long-term goal  by making me more aware of the tools I could use to help me figure out problems in my code but in addition to  this it will also help me to better understand to always reread my code to making sure everything is being called if it  needs to be or to check for consistent spelling. 


## Java script debug 

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
- It is a tool that allows people look at there values and verbal while allowing you to add breakpoints which allow you to look at parts of your code to breakdown where you could bee having problems.
- In simple Termes js debugger tool allows you to look over your code where you can break it dow and see what part or parts did or did not work so that you can see where your error was.  

### Define what a breakpoint is.
- A break point allows you to add break your code into different parts allowing you to test the specific part of your code to se if it works or if in needs some fixing. 

### What is the call stack? 
- It is the show you what current code was execution to get the line you were or are working on.
