## CSS 

### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
- This means it can only mange one layout at a time by using a single axis.
- main axis the primary direction 
-cross axis perpendicular to the main
Or in much simpler termers it can only do one at a time not both because it is to much. 

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
- the difference is the main axis gets spacing alignment and wrapping management while cross axis can only stack items along the main.


### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
- it can impact them because it could confuse users on different levels a good example is when you change the order property and leave the HTML the same this could confuse a person who's main accessibly comes from looking at the screen reading because items are not matching up. 


## layout CSS

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
- some advantages are all children of container take up a equal amount of value consisting of width and Hight. In addition to this all columns layouts become the same height regardless of its contents and amount.

### How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
- it connects with my long term goal because it is helping me get introduced to more useful items I could use to better my code. But in addition to this it is helping me get familiar with different programing witch will allow me to grow more and have a better understanding of more programming options that could be helpful or easier to use and mange.
