### What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
- A way you could use this attribute is when someone who is hard of seining needs a image or picture described to them.
by adding or using the alt attribute you are adding a words or text that can be read out loud to describe the image.     

### How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
- You can do this by using the alt attribute which lets you a description to a image. By doing this you can add a great descriptor to the image allowing for people of hard seeing to get an idea of how you image looks like. 


### Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
- A good time to use the figure element would be when you are trying to group elements that belong together for example you can do this with a image when you have a description of what the image is. EX empanada with a image of a empanada here you describe what the image is as well as a image of it. 


### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
- The difference between them are one is more simpler animation allowing for more changes from color to size and it usually is a small file while the other one allows for slightly more complex animation making resizing and coloring more limited if not quality can become worse. in addition to this a bigger file is needed for a more complex animation.
- or put more simply svg allows people to make animations which are simpler allowing for alterations of color and size to be greater.
- while a gif allows people to make more complex animation but by doing this it limits color and size sometimes even the quality.      

### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
- you would use a PNG or webp but for a website I would suggest better using a PNG because it makes the images more precises and much cleaner.     


## CSS

### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
- The difference between them is background color changes the color of the background weather it is the text or the whole page while foreground color is used to change the color of text and boxes in a much simpler background like its name changes the background color while foreground color can change the color of text borders and boxes.


### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
- I would do this by adding a background color that is pleasing to the eye and nice to look at in addition to this  I would change the color of the text to match or give contras to the background color so it looks bice but also so it is readable. If there are images I could also try to make the colors of the background and text give a matching them to the image so it dose not look out of place.
