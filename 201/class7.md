## Domain Modeling 

### Explain why we need domain modeling.
- We need domain modeling because without it the website wont run correctly or at all. In addition to this without it wont know its parameters of what it is it is supposed to do. 


## HTML Table Basics

### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
- They should not be used for table layout because it reduces accessibility to people who are visually impaired. In addition to this it also can make the code harder to write and debug. Not just  this but it also can affect how effective they are when being view in other devices because there is a chance it will not adapt correctly so you might have to do additional coding for more properties.  

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
- Td-table data cells of a table that contain data
- Tr-table row defines row of cells in a table 
- Th-table heeder of a group of table cells 
T-head   contains heeder rows
 T-body  groups main content of the table.

## Introducing Constructors

### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
- A constructor is specialized method of a object  that is called when you create a object of a class some advantages of using it are how it keeps everting consistent while also improving its readability. In addition to this it also makes it easier to work with.  
 
### How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
- It differs because object literal allows for a simple and quick simple object's without needing to use class or construct. 

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience

- "prototype is just a property that every function in JavaScript has and, as we saw above, it allows us to share methods across all instances of a function."- (from beginner guide to java script)

- inheritance allows you to crate relationships between class and objects by making it a  hierarchical relationships. Or in much simpler terms class and objects come together in a order of which holds more power.
