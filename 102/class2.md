# hello my name is Daniel solano and bellow I will be talking about growth mindset and what is it and how it can effect your way of thinking. 

## what is having a growth mindset?
 having a growth mindset means that you are able to beyond what you believe and able to grow from this. This means your believes on things are not fixed you are able to grow and improve from them. this means you are**not looking at something challenging and thinking this is hard therefore I can not do it instead you think while it is hared with enough work I can get it done.**

## Things to think about to help you develop/ maintain a growth mindset
1. remember to not look at something challenging as something you will never be able to do instead view it as something you have not yet fully learned or mastered.
2. when someone **criticism don't imminently view it as something negative instead view it as feedback** or a performance cheek this feedback is not meant to make look or fell bad instead it is meant to be advice to be used to improve your work.
3. another thing when thinking about growth mindset is to never view someone's success as a threat this is something that can really effect you in a negative way instead **look at there success as something motivational.** Because when you view it like this you are able to find more success.
