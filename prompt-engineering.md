## The baking time for a cake depends on several factors, including:

- Size of the cake pan: Larger cakes typically take longer to bake.
- Type of cake: Dense cakes like pound cakes may require longer baking times than lighter cakes like angel food cakes.
- Oven temperature: Following the recipe's recommended temperature is crucial.
- Cake batter consistency: Thicker batters may take longer to bake than thinner ones.
## General guidelines:

- Cupcakes: 15-20 minutes
- Small round cakes (8-inch): 25-35 minutes
- Larger round cakes (9-inch): 30-40 minutes
- Loaf cakes: 45-60 minutes
- The best way to determine if a cake is done is to use a toothpick or cake tester. Insert it into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is done. If it comes out with crumbs, bake for a few more minutes.
- Always refer to the specific recipe you're using for the most accurate baking time
